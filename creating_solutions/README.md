## Creating Solutions

Solutions are a way of logically grouping related development and administrative efforts together under a single concept.  A solution is always associated with a contract, which defines the scope of platform resources that will be made available to it.  Once a company has created a solution, they can begin creating solution instances, which will contain the applications and other platform resources dedicated to it.  A single solution can have any number of solution instances, and is only limited by what is defined in the contract.  A solution also has artifact repositories, and a set of releases, which are associated to it.

A Solution Center Company Admin role will be able to create multiple solutions for their company. A solution name can merely represent a project name, which could map to one of your customers.
