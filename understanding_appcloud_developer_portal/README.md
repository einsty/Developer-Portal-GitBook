# Understanding Covisint Platform
This section denotes the users and entities that are part of the Covisint Platform solution.

The term platform refers to the Covisint Cloud Platform that companies can use to develop and run custom applications based on Covisint APIs.  There are many components that make up the Covisint Cloud Platform, but at a high-level, they can be broken down into the following categories:

Platform Applications and APIs (e.g. Connect, CIS and Identity APIs)
Platform Application Services (e.g. API Gateway, databases and consolidated logging) 
Platform Administration (e.g. Developer Portal)
Customer Applications (primarily portal applications at this time)

The following diagram illustrates how different components of the Covisint Platform are tied together.

1. Covisint Exchange Operator will send an invite to a customer who would like to access the Platform.
2. Upon receiving the invitation, the customer will register with our Covisint Identity Service which manages all the user accounts and their access.
