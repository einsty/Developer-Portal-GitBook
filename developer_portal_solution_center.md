## Developer Portal Solutions Center
The Solution Center is an application within the Developer Portal that provides administrative control over the platform.  The application is used by both Covisint and external companies that are developing on the platform.

Administrators can centrally manage multiple solutions within their organization, as well manage users involved in different projects. It allows developers and administrators to create, build, and launch new solutions using the self-service tools.

Here are the key features of the Developer Portal Solution Center:
* Ability to build portlets and dynamic content widgets
* Self-service deployments
* Instance management
* Logging/debugging
* Monitoring
