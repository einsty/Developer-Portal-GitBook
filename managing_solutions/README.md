## Managing Solutions
Once a solution is created, you can manage its artifact repositories, and a set of releases, which are associated to it.


### What is an Artifact?

The term artifact refers to those items which a developer creates that can be deployed to an instance.  For now, these are limited to portlets and themes, which can be deployed to a Covisint portal.  Artifacts can be uploaded into an external artifact repository that is owned by company.  From there, each artifact can be used in any number of releases.
