# Overview of AppCloud Developer Portal

Developer Portal is a single location for everything related to developing applications on the Covisint Cloud Platform.  Its primary functions are divided between the Solution Center, which provides administrative control of the platform, and the Reference Center, which provides reference material for developing on the platform.  The Developer Portal requires an identity realm for managing company and user accounts, so a special administrative realm called the Platform Identity Realm has been created for its use.
