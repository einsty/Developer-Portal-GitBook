## Developer Portal Overview

Covisint Developer Portal is a single location for everything related to developing applications on the Covisint Cloud Platform. It empowers developers to build applications and services, which can be offered over the Internet. It is built on the Cloud Foundry open source technology, which makes it easier to deploy, run, and scale applications.

Covisint Developer Portal offers the following features:
* Comprehensive suite of APIs covering Identity, Portal, and Messaging allows you to customize your application according to your needs
* Faster delivery of new functionality and iteration on the system
* Reduces complexity and makes your business more agile and efficient
* Provides a secure, customized, single entry point to all of your solution needs
* Reduced technical maintenance
* Leverages different code on different servers, and make it work together seemlessly in a standardized format that makes sense in terms of what developers are used to seeing.

Developer Portal abstracts away the headaches of managing, security, and scaling, which enables the developers to move from concept to workable product as quickly as possible. An Organization can focus on two things: customers and spend more time building the application.
