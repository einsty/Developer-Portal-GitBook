# Developer Portal Solution Center Roles

The Solution Center is an application within the Developer Portal that provides administrative control over the platform.  The application is used by both Covisint and external companies that are developing on the platform. It has self-service administrative functions for most of the concepts mentioned in this section.

The Developer Portal Solution Center has its own set of associated roles, and when a user is granted a role, they gain access to specific features for that application.
